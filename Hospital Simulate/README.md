### IMPORTANT NOTE
In this excercise I reused my exisiting c# .Net code for a similar application that i developed for a Hospital.
However, I tried covering all the key technical concepts from the back end perspective to front-end perspective i would say a little more in depth than what you mention in the requirement.

To this end, I would appreciate a technical discussion or interview so that I will be able to shed more light on this technical aspects covered here in the project.
